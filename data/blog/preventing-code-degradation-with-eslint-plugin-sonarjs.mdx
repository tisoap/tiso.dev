If you have worked with any sizable JavaScript project, be a front-end React application or a back-end Node service, you are most likely aware of the importance of using ESLint and other static code analysis tools.

In this article I'll show you a less know ESLint plugin that will help keep your codebase clean, by detecting early _bugs_ and _code smells_. It's the [eslint-plugin-sonarjs](https://github.com/SonarSource/eslint-plugin-sonarjs), made by the same guys behind [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/).

## Installation

You'll need a JavaScript/Typescript project with [ESLint configured](https://github.com/eslint/eslint#installation-and-usage) in it.

On your project, install `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` as a dev dependency using `npm`:

```bash
npm install eslint-plugin-sonarjs --save-dev
```

Once installed, update your `.eslintrc` file to include the following:

```json
{
	"plugins": ["sonarjs"],
	"extends": ["plugin:sonarjs/recommended"]
}
```

## What is it checking?

You can check the [full list of rules here](https://github.com/SonarSource/eslint-plugin-sonarjs#rules). By using the `plugin:sonarjs/recommended` configuration you'll have all of them enabled, with a few exceptions.

All those rules are intended to catch code that have potential bugs or code smells, like [having too many switch case statements](https://github.com/SonarSource/eslint-plugin-sonarjs/blob/master/docs/rules/max-switch-cases.md) or [duplicated branches of code](https://github.com/SonarSource/eslint-plugin-sonarjs/blob/master/docs/rules/no-all-duplicated-branches.md).

But the most important rule of this set is the **[Cognitive Complexity](https://github.com/SonarSource/eslint-plugin-sonarjs/blob/master/docs/rules/cognitive-complexity.md)** one.

## The Cognitive Complexity Rule

It checks against actual perceived complexity in code, given it a score on how hard is for a human to understand it. It's _not_ the same as [Cyclomatic Complexity](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/complexity), which measures how many different paths a programs code can take. You can read [the full paper on Cognitive Complexity](https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf) to learn more about it.

This rule alone can act as a guard rail to prevent a project from becoming increasingly more complex and hard to maintain over time. You can also mix in a [max-lines](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-lines#enforce-a-maximum-file-length-max-lines) rule to be even safer.

And since it's a ESLint rule with a configurable score, it helps reduce discussions about code quality and maintainability inside a pull request, making them more focused around the problem the PR is trying to solve.
